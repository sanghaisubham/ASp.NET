CACHE VS COOKIES 
================


What are Cookies?

A cookie is small piece of information stored on your computer by a website you visit. Every time the user loads the website, 
the browser sends the cookie back to the server to notify the website of the user’s previous activity. Cookies have a certain life span defined by their creators. 4
At the end of this, a cookie becomes expired. Cookies often track information like how frequently the user visits, what are the times of visits, what banners have been
clicked on, what button clicked, user preferences, items in shopping cart, etc.
This allows the site to present you with information customized to fit your needs. Cookies are usually used to store information needed for shorter periods.
Cookies was first introduced by Netscape and in those earlier stages cookies did not receive good acceptance, since rumours said it might hack your personal data. 
Later people realized that cookies are actually harmless, and now they are highly accepted.

What are Caches?

A web cache (or HTTP cache) is an information technology for the temporary storage (caching) of web documents, such as HTML pages and images, 
to reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag. 
A web cache system stores copies of documents passing through it; subsequent requests may be satisfied from the cache if certain conditions are met. 
A web cache system can refer either to an appliance, or to a software. For example, when you open some websites with large pictures and video’s, 
it might take a considerable amount of time for the website to load. The web browser stores the site contents like the images, videos, audio etc. 
on your computer so the next time you load the same website you will find it loading faster.


Now let’s see the difference between Cache and Cookies

Although cookies and cache are two ways to store data on client’s machine, but there are difference between cache and cookies and they serve different purposes.
• Cookie is used to store information to track different characteristics related to user, while cache is used to make the loading of web pages faster.
• Cookies stores information such as user preferences, while cache will keep resource files such as audio, video or flash files.
• Typically, cookies expire after some time, but cache is kept in the client’s machine until they are removed manually by the user.


Example
-------
Suppose we searched for poles on earth in Google.It took 10 min to be searched.We opened a dew links on the search result
page.Next time when we search for same title , it will take lesser time , to open the search result pages 
due to *CACHE* .

The links we opened will be highlighted in purple due to *COOKIES*.Even on typing the title in Google ,
when we  type name partially , Google will pop on whole title highlighted due to *COOKIES*

CACHE vs COOKIES vs SESSION
============================

A cookie is a small file containing a record that you have been to such and such website, and answered such and such question, or other information about you.

A cache is an area of your hard drive that the browser uses to save frequently-fetched items, so they load faster when you need them.

A session can be several things; for the user of a web browser, it most likely refers to the period of time that a remote website considers you “active”; 
if you do not make a web request with your browser for a certain time period, your “session” will time out, and you’ll have to log in again.

Example
-------
Suppose we open a website , 

When Browser connects to the server it creates a *SESSION* , which the server keeps track of .
This session maintains our connection and other information server-side.

As we visit the pages on our website,our browser keeps local copies of the page we view to 
speed up page requests.This local storage of pages is the "CACHE"

The website may send a request to our browser to store info on our client computer.
It may store login info.This info stored on the client's computer at the server's request is called a "COOKIE"
