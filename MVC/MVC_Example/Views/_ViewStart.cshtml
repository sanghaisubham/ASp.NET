    View is a user interface.
    View displays data from the model to the user and also enables them to modify the data.
    Different action methods of a single controller class can render different views,

    So the Views folder contains a separate folder for each controller with the same name as controller,
    in order to accommodate multiple views

    Microsoft introduced the Razor view engine and packaged with MVC 3
    We can write a mix of html tags and server side code in razor view.
    Razor uses @ character for server side code instead of traditional <% %>
